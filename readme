This is a silly little program that randomly produces rectangular mazes of arbitrary size. What could be more fun than solving a 1000 x 1000 maze?

I wrote program because it was more fun than writing a paper for class. The code is not necessarily any good. It produces a minimum spanning tree from a randomly weighted grid graph using Prim's algorithm.

To compile this with g++, use the following:
g++ -O2 -std=c++11 *.cpp -omazegen
